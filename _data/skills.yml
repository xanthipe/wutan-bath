tai-chi:
  title: Tai Chi
  description: |
    Tai Chi is a gentle martial art that improves physical stability and balance through slow,
    flowing movements the form a series of postures following a sequence. It is primarily a 
    noncontact art that exercises the mind, body and soul.

    At [Wutan Bath](../school/#wutan-bath) we teach the five traditional styles of Tai Chi, all of which have the same
    movements and sequences. The Yang style is a more gentle, flowing form that is often
    practised at a slower pace. The Chen style is more energetic and focuses on the martial arts
    aspect of the movements. There is also the Hao (Wu) style with its very small and subtle
    movements and higher stance, the Sun style that places an emphasis on agile footwork and
    the Wu style, which focuses on extending the body so it is leaning rather than being centred.

    Tai Chi, regardless of the style, is taught along with related arts such as [Qigong](../arts/#qigong) (an
    energetic series of movements used to get the muscles and blood moving freely), Sensing
    Hands (moving hands in tune with a partner), Hsing I (a form of Chinese boxing) and Pa Gua
    (circle walking) to give you a fully rounded martial arts education.

    Wutan Kung Fu covers aspects of Wing Chun, Chai Lei Fut, Praying Mantis, Wing Chun, Ba Ji
    Chuan, Pi Qua, Mi Zhong and Kickboxing. While you might not recognize the names, you will
    almost certainly have heard of the Five Animals style of Chai Lei Fut, and Wing Chun is the
    art that started Bruce Lee&apos;s career.

    We cover a full range of techniques and training methods that focus on the students needs.
    They include forms practice, two-person practice, practical self-defence, sparring, sensitivity
    training and conditioning.

    Weapons training is added in time to further students understanding of the core principles
    of martial arts.

    All the classes are run in a friendly environment with an emphasis on developing confidence
    and discipline.
qigong:
  title: Qigong
  description: |
    Pronounced &lsquo;chi gong&rsquo;, Qigong was developed as part of Traditional Chinese Medicine
    thousands of years ago. Today, there are many styles and forms of Qigong (which is also
    known as chi kung). Different movements are used to open the flow of energy via meridians
    and acupuncture points to various organs, muscles, tendons and other tissues in the body
    and to promote body fluids such as blood, synovial and lymph. These movements, which can
    be dynamic or meditative, are made while taking long, slow breaths (Qigong is from qi,
    meaning &lsquo;subtle breath&rsquo;, and gong, meaning &lsquo;skill cultivated through steady practise&rsquo;).

    Qigong is suitable for everyone, and our classes start with Qigong as warm-up exercises
    before moving on to other forms.
