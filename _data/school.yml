    Search the internet and you can find many independent martial arts instructors, but that&apos;s 
    not the case with the Wutan School, where the instructors can trace a lineage of teaching 
    back to Wu Chong (1712&ndash;1797), whose skills in martial arts so impressed a Taoist that he 
    taught the young Wu for ten years. Six generations later, those skills were taught to
    [Liu Yun Qiao](../school/#liu-yun-qiao), who would become the founder of the Wutan school.

    Wutan UK, founded by [Mr They Soon Tuan](../school/#they-soon-tuan), was officially registered with the British 
    Kung Fu Council and Martial Arts Commission in March 1981.

    The Wutan school covers a range of martial arts, from Tai Chi, Pa Gua and Hsing I to Chai Lei Fut,
    Praying Mantis, Wing Chun, Ba Ji Chuan, Pi Qua, Mi Zhong and Kickboxing. All these arts 
    cover both the internal (meditative) and external (combative) features of the martial arts. To

    Bath Wutan has been going for more than three decades, providing the well-documented
    benefits of [Tai Chi](../arts/#tai-chi), [Kung Fu](../arts/#kung-fu) and [Qigong](../arts/#qigong). 
    In fact, the NHS recommends Tai Chi and Qigong as forms of exercise and relaxation that can improve 
    flexibility, mobility, balance and posture, as well as reduce stress and tension.

    Here&apos;s a brief history on how Wutan Bath came into being: due to an error in the Bath Chronicle, 
    in which the wrong location was printed, one day in 
    April 1991 around 40 students waited with great anticipation at Manvers St Baptist Church for a 
    Tai Chi demonstration, while Andrew Carter, the Wutan instructor, sat disconsolately in an empty
    hall at Holy Trinity Church on Monmouth Place! However, a successful session was achieved
    the following week.

    Wutan Bath was established in 1992. By the late 1990s the branch moved to Percy
    Community Centre on New King Street to accommodate much larger classes. In 2002, Wutan
    Bath moved to its current location, Hayesfield Lower School on Brougham Hayes. The branch
    has extended to additional instructors who teach at other sites.
