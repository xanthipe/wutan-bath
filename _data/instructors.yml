  name: David Rutherford

    David was taught Tai Chi and Kung Fu by Andrew Carter, one of They&apos;s high-ranking senior
    instructors in the [Wutan](../school/#wutan) school. When Andrew introduced Wutan to Bath in 1991 &ndash; initially
    with 5-hour sessions on Sunday afternoons &ndash; David completed the Tai Chi short form in 16
    weeks and also began Sensing Hands, Pa Gua, a Stick routine and Wu-style Tai Chi.

    Andrew had to return to the Wutan UK headquarters in Southampton after a year. David
    Rutherford, along with Steve Kruk and Martin Chivers, were determined to continue the
    school&apos;s presence in Bath, so they travelled to Southampton on Sundays for training with
    Master They Soon Tuan, the head of Wutan UK. At Southampton, David continued his training
    and also completed the 8 Palm Pa Gua sequence, Tai Chi Sword form and Broadsword form,
    along with their applications. It is natural to try and emulate your teacher in order to maintain the
    original &lsquo;message&rsquo;, and for years David has structured his class around Andrew&apos;s words and
    methods.

    From a young age, Marick has always been interested in the Chinese martial arts and the
    philosophy behind it. Throughout childhood he suffered from poor health, and when he started
    playing the flute, he realized that he needed to improve his health. He originally started to learn
    martial arts to help his flute playing and develop his focus &ndash; but not only did his health improve
    quickly, he discovered something much deeper in his inner being.

    Marick began his Tai Chi training with David Rutherford and studied Kung Fu and Chinese
    kickboxing under Martin Chivers at Wutan Bath in 1995. He trained wholeheartedly every hour he
    could and was soon training with Master Wu Song Fa during his regular visits to the UK. After
    Martin stopped teaching, Marick took on his Kung Fu classes and was invited to teach Tai Chi as
    well. Marick is fully committed to spreading Wutan&apos;s teachings.

james-davies:
  name: James Davies

    After doing Yoga for 7 years, James felt he wanted something more active to complement the progress he 
    had made with Yoga. He also needed to find a way of looking after himself physically to help his recovery 
    from various injuries. He started with Kung Fu and Kickboxing. He then went to Tai Chi as a kind of 
    &lsquo;why not?&rsquo;. He didn't expect it to offer anything different to Yoga and Kung Fu, but not only did he find 
    that Tai Chi complemented both of them beautifully, it also has much to add. While he has benefited greatly 
    physically, the emotional and psychological well-being he has experienced have been life changing, and he 
    has made many friends and great memories along the way. 

    James feels honoured to be teaching for the Wutan school. He feels traditional Chinese martial arts are 
    truly a treasure that can really help our collective future. He is joined by his partner in teaching his 
    classes and is proud that their children are all still actively training and assist them with teaching. 
    He will always be grateful for the day he joined Wutan and believes that training in Tai Chi, Kung Fu and 
    Kickboxing with Wutan for the last 20 or so years has provided him with so much.

    Siobhan started her training with the Bath branch of the Wutan school in 1997 and soon realised the amazing benefits for mind, 
    body and inner well-being. What started as a once-a-week class as a hobby soon turned into many hours of dedicated and fun 
    training, with life changing effects, under the guidance of They Soon Tuan and Master Wu Song Fa. After being asked to teach by 
    They, Siobhan began a journey of instructor training and personal development within the arts.

    The comprehensive and progressive syllabus of the school gives a great foundation and a lifetime worth of knowledge to students,
    whether they prefer a short course or on-going training. Over many years of teaching, Siobhan has seen students benefitting 
    profoundly, in so many ways, and finds it to be a rewarding experience and a privilege to be part of her students&apos; journey
    and development. Siobhan feels honoured and grateful to be able to share such a gift benefitting students, herself and our wider 
    communities.
