    ![Grand Master Liu Yun Qiao](/assets/photos/about/liuyunqiao.jpg#left) At the age of seven, Liu Yun Qiao 
    (1909&ndash;1992) began his training with Li Su Wen (1864&ndash;1934),
    perhaps the most famous practitioner of the six generations who were taught Pa Ze,
    starting with Wu Chong (1712&ndash;1797). Liu would eventually become the head trainer to the
    bodyguards for the president of China. Grand Master Liu Yun Qiao retired from his post in
    1966 and founded the Wutan martial arts school. He chose 12 disciples, most of whom were
    already highly skilled in martial arts, to teach them his skills. From this auspicious beginning,
    the Wutan School now has masters and schools throughout the world.

    They Soon Tuan began learning the martial arts from his father by the age of seven,
    practising five hours a day, and at the age of 15 was put in charge of his Crane Kung Fu
    school. His Kung Fu master sent him to train under other teachers to learn different systems.
    After many years of training, Master Wu Song Fa accepted They as his student. On arriving in
    the UK to study at university, They founded a martial arts school here in 1977 to promote
    the correct teaching of authentic Chinese martial arts (which are collectively known as
    Wushu), and he was given permission by Grand Master Liu Yun Qiao to use the Wutan name
    in 1986.

    Master They has held the role of Taolu Director of the British Council for Chinese Martial
    Arts (BCCMA), instructing top athletes that include UK and international champions, and has
    trained British Wushu teams. His Wutan UK school has brought many thousands of people to
    greater health and happiness over more than four decades.
