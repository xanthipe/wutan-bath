Throughout June, July and August, starting on June 5th, David Rutherford's Wednesday evening Tai Chi class will move from its usual venue at Hayesfield School and will instead take place in Henrietta Park, Bath, from 19:00 to 20:30, at a reduced cost of Â£10 per session.

This will obviously be weather-dependent, so keep an eye on the WhatsApp group - David will announce there if any sessions need to be cancelled due to weather. Otherwise, assume it's on!
