David Rutherford's Wednesday night class will be returning to Hayesfield School from the 9th of September - it'll also be returning to its original timings (7pm to 9pm) and prices (£10 for Qigong only, £12 for the full class).

Class payments can now be taken in cash, by BACS transfer, or if Warren is in via contactless card (we'll get other people set up soon).
